	<p><span>Maspik</span> (Hebrew for 'enough') is a simple Chrome extension to help you decide
						   whether you wish to support Israeli businesses in the light of the
						   ongoing occupation of Palestine.</p>

	<p>At the moment our coverage is very limited, though we hope to expand this. Please do not
	   rely on us to ensure that you don't unwittingly aid the occupation and share ways we
	   could improve.</p>

	<p>Our initial motivation was the realisation that articles on the situation
		in Israel/Palestine would invariably be followed by some links generating revenue for
		one side in that conflict.</p>

	<p>Whatever your view on that situation we found it distasteful that people were
	   unwittingly favouring one side or the other everytime they clicked one of those links.
	</p>

	<p>Maspik puts the power to decide what is right or wrong back in your hands.</p>

	<h1>What We Highlight:</h1>
	<h2>We currently target the following companies:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#outbrain"></a>
			<h1>Outbrain</h1>
			<p>Installed on over 100,000 websites it serves 15 billion page views a month. Its most
			   recent funding round raised $35m. It earns money everytime you click on a link it
			   provides. It also provides navigation within sites - making sites increasingly
			   dependent on it.
			 </p>

			<p>Please ask <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/contact/">Outbrain</a> to oppose the
			   occupation. You might also like to contact the editor of any websites using
			   Outbrain to ask them to reconsider.</p>
		</li>

		<li><a href="#taboola"></a>
			<h1>Taboola</h1>
			<p>Another Israeli content marketing site.</p>

			<p>Please ask <a href="https://www.taboola.com/contact">Taboola</a> to oppose the
			   occupation. You might also like to contact the editor of any websites using
			   Taboola to ask them to reconsider.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
